###One thing at a time:

To be honest, I am no designer or HTML ninja or CSS guy or javascript man. I manage to drive through these stuffs in slow pace and not shy or embarrased to admit.

Someday I would... someday, may be after years. But yes someday I would...

- [x] Optimize the stylesheet and sweep off silly stuffs
- [x] Use LESS (or SASS) to maintain the theme styles
- [x] Work on responsive UI layout implementation in better way
- [x] Work on improvemnts of HTML elements used to get the most out of HTML5
- [ ] Modify theme so it would validate HTML5 and CSS validator tests (I found it fails with few errors and warnings)
- [ ] Bring theme color variants, though orange is not a bad color
- [ ] Explore Handlebar, let's see if we can do something interesting or unique
